# About me 

<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi, I am Mateusz, I am a student and an engineer.

 My curiosity and perseverance are reasons why I code. As I am strongly willing to experience more from the surrounding
  world and understand it I did start coding. The joy of learning it and applying it to many issues as well as, my
   recent professional experience encouraged me to utilize what I've learned in my professional path.
