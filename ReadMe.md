# About me 

<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi, I am Mateusz, I am a (final year) student and an engineer.

 My curiosity and perseverance are reasons why I code. As I am strongly willing to experience more from the surrounding
  world and understand it I did start coding. The joy of learning it and applying it to many issues as well as, my
   recent professional experience encouraged me to utilize what I've learned in my professional path.

## Project Status
The project is: _on Hold_. Working on improvement of UI.java code, unit tests, creating GUI.

## Room for Improvement
The Main field of improvement is reliability. Although it seems reliable after manual testing,
included automated tests are not sufficient. 

Room for improvement:
- testing (especially validation methods)
- GUI
- database (consider : SQLite, JSON)
- UI, validation methods
